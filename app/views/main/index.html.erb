		<h3>Key knowledge:</h3>
		<p>This is a "social graph" in which people are nodes and lines represent connections between them.
			The size of a node corresponds to how many things you share a common appreciation for. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Questions:</h3>
		<h5>Why don't you connect to Facebook?</h5>
		<p>On Facebook you have a lot of friends, probably hundreds.  For the 6 Away graph we wanted to keep
			connections few and personal.  If you can't think of them off the top of your head don't worry about
			including them.  You will probably only have 20 connections.</p>
		<br>
		<h5>What's the story?</h5>
		<p>There are lots of opportunities to meet people, but you don't stay friends with most of people you meet.
		   We believe the the secret to meeting a friend who you can stay friends with is connections.  A friend of a
		   friend is likely to live near you and be someone you have a high probabilty of seeing again - because your
		   friends already do.<br>6 Away helps this happen.</p>

		<h3>Interactions:</h3>
		<p>Click on nodes to expand them and explore the graph.</p>
		<h5>Making new connections<h5>
		<p>Click on one of your orange categories to expand it.  You can then enter the name of the person you want to connect to.</p>
		<h5>So... what should I see in the graph?</h5>
		<p>Larger nodes are people who you are similar to you.  If you see a friend of a friend with a large node, maybe you should meet them!  We aren't going to tell you how you should, maybe it is going to watch a movie together with your mutual friend or just remembering the name &#8212; it's up to you!</p>
